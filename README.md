# LLM Parallelism Explorer PoC

LLM Parallelism Explorer PoC is a cutting-edge research tool designed to optimize parallelism strategies for large language models, with a particular focus on Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. This proof-of-concept project performs a comprehensive search across various parallelism configurations to estimate memory usage and identify optimal setups for efficient training on distributed systems.
